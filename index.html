                And it's embeded deep down in its core, however maybe not in the most obvious way.

                * I make dinner to my kids. And if you have kids maybe you know it - lets see if there will be a few nods in the audience.
                * I know that at that point of time they can handle only fruits.
                * So I offer fruits, but they insist also on Sandwich. Pizza. Pasta. Salad. And cake. And Milkshake. And potato chips
                and also that slimmy sugary thingy I later need to clean up. And tortia. And biscuits. And Salmon. Oh boy, they claim they are so into Salmon.
                And Vanilla cake, and some chocolate to balance it. And yogurt, because why not.
                * And they really insist. And I know it's going to end bad, but I try to be a good dad.
                * But those small, manipulative bastards - and honest to god I'm not even sure if they are really mine -
                it's obvious they get kick out of it, eventhough it's clear they are not going to eat any of it.
                * And then my wife joins, and starts with her accusations and going all crazy
                * and then I go crazy, and eventually I start screeming at my wife "you and your mother are going to take me down the my grave!"
                * So I guess projects are a bit like that, right? We need to serve our clients only fruits. Only what they really want and can afford.
                * Project is the sum of it's issues
                * Setting the hours is setting the expectations
                * Also self fullfiling prophesy - developer can code for ever.

                    * Frustrated with Angular, I was poking around React, and soon found myself with Elm
                    * Functional programming language. It compiles to JS. But it's not Typescirpt
                    * It doesn't try to fix JS. But rather say, JS is wonderful, but as humans we shouldn't interact with it.
                    * Staticlly typed. It has an amazing compiler which makes sure there are no runtime exceptions. It's immutable.
                    * In general after years of Angualr 1, and playing a bit with React, Front end has became fun again.
                    * Development is much faster and more stable than ever, Admitedlly, ever since I divied into Elm and FP I started using it I've started seeing the flaws in Drupal.

              * Approchable
              * Huge community
              * Eco-system, Pantheon/ Platform/ Amazee IO
              * Monthly releases
              * Wednesday security releases
              * DrupalCon, Drupal Association, Drupal Drama
              * Drush/ Drupal console
              * Tons of code we didn't have to write, or test
              * 15 years of experience!
              * I remember Dris saying back in CPH that we're tied in the hip to the PHP community.
              * Are we? Are we because we are constantly choosing, or because we're affraid of questioning.
              * I'm not advocating to let go of PHP, but about letting go of the fears. Drupal has been in its safe zone
              for a long time.
              * I'll tell what I tell my clients. You problem is not code. Lets say we have the perfect system, whatever
              we want will be done tomorrow. What would it be.
              * And also, how would I know I succedded or failed. What's the matrix.
              * That talk is quicker, and adaptive, like coding but it's less expensive in time.

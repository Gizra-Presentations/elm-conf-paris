                 who doesn't care about busniess. Don't shut yourself out.
                 I'm not going to talk about fortune 500 money. Or about corrupted amount of money. or some crazy excel sheets and busniess plans.
                * No, I'm going to talk about the good money. You know, the one the runs your busniess, or pays your salary.
                * The kind of money that payed your ticket to come here, or the one that you will pay in order

                * I know that at that point of time they can handle only fruits.
                * So I offer fruits, but they insist also on Sandwich. Pizza. Pasta. Salad. And cake. And Milkshake. And potato chips
                and also that slimmy sugary thingy I later need to clean up. And tortia. And biscuits. And Salmon. Oh boy, they claim they are so into Salmon.
                And Vanilla cake, and some chocolate to balance it. And yogurt, because why not.
                * And they really insist. And I know it's going to end bad, but I try to be a good dad.
                * But those small, manipulative bastards - and honest to god I'm not even sure if they are really mine -
                it's obvious they get kick out of it, eventhough it's clear they are not going to eat any of it.
                * And then my wife joins, and starts with her accusations and going all crazy
                * and then I go crazy, and eventually I start screeming at my wife "you and your mother are going to take me down the my grave!"
                * So I guess projects are a bit like that, right? We need to serve our clients only fruits. Only what they really want and can afford.

                  * How to structure a big app.
                  * Authentication, Routing, Type safe linking, Pusher integration
                  * Travis integration, WebdriverIO
                  * This is our starting point for every new project, and we constantly improve it

              <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                * The compiler reduces your cognitive load, so you are not afarid of constatnly adding new stuff
                or polishing old ones
                * It has a community of developers. Sure, much less than React, but it seems the ratio of experience, seniority
                and very importantly -- availability very high.

                * For me in Gizra, it's getting more clients and project
                * And as a result get more elm developers.
                * btw, funny I mention it, because we are actually looking in Gizra for elm developers.
                * And for you? what is next for you?
                * I don't really know, because I don't know most of you. But this is what I can suggest:
                If you are not the owners of the business yourself, the ones that makes the final decision
                then step into their office, and tell them: "Listen guys"

                * (Close eyes, breath)
                * "Listen folks". Let me cut to the chase. You are loosing money.
                Or at least not earning as much as you could and should. With Elm you'll get quicker results,
                with less bugs, with less stress from the developers, and getting
                new talent isn't going to be harder than your current sitaution.
                * Then you can slowly step outside. Maybe start bowing and add a slightly crazy laugh.
                The last part is obviously just to make extra sure their reaction is "What the fuck?!"
                * But honestly, you know what can happen from using Elm. Something that is even harder
                then improving your companies budget line.
                * No, what could happen is that you, your boss, your colleages, your users,
                and maybe even the people sorrounding you will .simply. become. happier.
